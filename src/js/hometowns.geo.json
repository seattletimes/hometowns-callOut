I think the propriety, especially, is comfortable for her. It’s fairly predictable but it doesn’t allow for much flexibility. (We are both the older child in the family, which may reinforce this if you subscribe to birth-order theories.) It’s always a tense visit, and our weekly phone calls often seem enough contact.

The curse of being an unincorporated community is the lack of planning, growth unrestrained by zoning regulations, etc. Federal Way suffered (and benefited) from the accident of being along the Pacific Hwy and later the Interstate 5 corridor, between two large cities. Like most of the towns and cities in South King County, it suffers from a lack of identity. To imagine that your town center is a shopping mall built on a swamp because of its convenience to the I-5 exit at 320th -- it's sad. The library, recently built, that was partially destroyed by arson in in 1975 took most of the tangible mementos of Federal Way's history along with it. Virtually all of the near wilderness I enjoyed in various corners of Federal Way in the 1960s fell victim to urban sprawl, as have many farms, local businesses, etc. I can remember a childhood of waiting at the end of my street early in the mornings during the summer for a dilapidated bus to arrive, take me to a berry farm owned by second- or third- generation Japanese Americans, to pick strawberries or raspberries for 90 cents a flat.
